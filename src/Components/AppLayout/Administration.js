        <b>Dr.Imran Khan Bangash</b> I hope that this website gives you a
        comprehensive understanding of what our hospital is offering for its
        patients and the community. I am proud to work for this institution and
        from my experience I can tell that we offer the best service in the
        region. Besides medical technology, which is at the highest level in the
        region, I can assure that the finest doctors, nurses, midwives and
        technicians are passionate to help you. From the busiest and highly
        performing Emergency Department up to all the other specialties we
        strive to apply best practices and new standards. We have all these
        services “under one roof” and that is an incredible advantage for our
        patients. What makes me happy everyday is that I can sense that our
        doctors and staff have passion for their work and have a true desire to
        care for you.
