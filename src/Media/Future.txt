1***** The appointment should be having a separate form for uploading or editing data because the appoitments is made by doctors there it need more fields in future that is why i will add it in future fillfreebeds.js
2***** expensedynamicdetails.js has th esearching in the database for type of an expense which should be changed into case insensitive after the creation of backend django
3***** expense.js addd expense button causes expendynamicdetails.js rerenders fix it later or the other solution is to make th html form in the expense.js file
